Manual Additions & Developer Notes
----------------------------------

This project intentionally excludes certain images and URLs from the core files. 
Below are the details of what needs to be added manually:

1. index.html
----------------
- This file does NOT currently include any <img> tags or image sections.
- If you wish to display images on the page, please add <img src="..." alt="..."> 
  tags manually where appropriate.

2. style.css
----------------
- The stylesheet references background images using CSS properties.
- However, the actual URLs or files for those images are not included.
- Please manually add valid background-image URLs in the relevant selectors.

3. assets/ or images/ folder
-----------------------------
- The assets/images folder is not populated yet.
- Testing was done but image behavior was not as expected.
- This folder is reserved for future updates — you can add your own images here.

General Note:
---------------
This project is still a work-in-progress (WIP), especially on mobile responsiveness. 
Margin, padding, and alignment issues may still appear on small screen devices.
