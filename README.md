## I Am Just a Freak 👾

This is a personal creative project built using **HTML** and **CSS** — a fun experiment to express emotions, aesthetics, and originality through code.

### 🌐 Live Site  
- As per schedule.

### 🧠 Features  
- Clean and expressive HTML structure  
- Stylish CSS design  
- Mobile-friendly layout (WIP / under improvement) — *currently some margin and alignment issues in mobile layouts*  
- Custom fonts and aesthetics  
- Just vibes.  
- Will be adding image support soon; currently in alpha stage :)

### 🗂️ Project Structure  
- index.html  
- style.css (background images and respective URLs are not included)  
- script.js (combined with mobile.js into a single, mobile- and desktop-compatible version)  
- assets or images (not added yet; testing was done but didn’t work as expected)

### ✍️ Author  
- Yash — just a freak making weirdly beautiful things on the web.
